Intro to Reznick Github 

## WELCOME
This platform's intended use is to share code, project files, and data easily across our lab. This is also a convenient way to track student progress if they were to work on your repository.

## Crash Course Into Github: 
Github is used as a version control platform. Long story short, this is a way to track any changes to your files, code, and projects which can be helpful to a large team sharing data. Through this platform, we can see other people's scripts, share data easily amongst ourselves, and also monitor undergrad progress. 

Folders on Github are called repositories (repos). Repos can be backed up on the github cloud, but can also be stored locally on your computer using the command "git clone". This command will clone your github repo onto your computer, and you can actually push updates from your cloned repository to your github repo. This can be a convenient way to backup your work, and also share your progress with other people. For some more basics on best repository practice, please review this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/best-practices-for-repositories).
