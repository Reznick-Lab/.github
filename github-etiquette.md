# Some Basic Rules/Tips for our Github Org Page

🚧👷‍♂️ SITE STILL UNDERGOING CONSTRUCTION 👷‍♂️🚧

1. Write scripts in your personal folder, unless you are working in teams.
2. While working in shared repos, please 'git branch' new commits/changes before pushing to main repo.
3. When committing changes, please write meaningful messages that are detailed and informative.
    - example of good commit: 'git commit -m "created a ggplot for sperm motility data"
    - example of bad commit: 'git commit -m "made changes"
    - note: 'git commit -m" commands ONLY make changes to local repository, and not cloud repository on github.
    - tip: it's good to make frequent commits to check versions of your file changes over a period of time. 
4. Use "git status" *frequently*. This will tell you what changes are pending, so that you don't muddy your branch.
