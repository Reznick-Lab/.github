## Hi there 👋

This is the official Reznick Lab Github! Please feel free to use this platform to upload code you'd like to share with each other or collaborators. Our PI, [David Reznick](https://davidreznick.weebly.com/evolution-of-the-placenta.html), focuses on Life History Evolution of Trinidadian guppies and the Evolution of the Placenta in Poeciliids.

## Prospective Students 
Interested in our lab and what we do? We are not hiring now, but may be hiring again in the near future.

- [Basic Git Hub Commands](../basic-git-commands.md)
- [Rules for this Org](../github-etiquette.md)

Note: Repositories uploaded to this organization are *project based* that way it's easier to find files especially if you are working on projects that share the same or similar scripts.

## 🚧 Future development 🚧
- this might be a great page to add some information about each of us that we can reference in this profile page. Especially if you'd like to advertise your work with other collaborators through this platform! I'm thinking that we can add a "Our Lab" section in this profile launch page.
